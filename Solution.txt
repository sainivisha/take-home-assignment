Part 1: Code Review & Debugging

Issues Identified

1. Missing Input Validation ( we can use Zod library for validation here)
Issue:No validation of incoming request data. Missing fields will cause KeyError.
Production Impact API crashes with 500 errors when clients send incomplete payloads

2. No Transaction Management
Issue : two separate commits create a race condition. If the second commit fails, we get orphaned products without inventory.
Production Impact:Data inconsistency. Products exist but can't be sold because inventory records are missing.

3. Missing SKU Uniqueness Constraint
Issue:No check for duplicate SKUs before insertion.
Production Impact:Database constraint violation errors (if unique index exists) or duplicate SKUs (if no constraint), breaking business logic.

4. No Error Handling
Issue:Database errors, connection issues, or constraint violations crash the endpoint
Production Impact:Poor user experience, unclear error messages, difficult debugging

5. Missing HTTP Status Codes
Issue:Returns 200 for all responses, even failures.
Production Impact:Clients can't distinguish success from failure programmatically

6. Decimal Precision Not Specified
Issue:Price field might lose precision if not properly typed in database
Production Impact:Financial calculations become inaccurate over time

7. No Authentication/Authorization
Issue:Anyone can create products for any warehouse
Production Impact:Security vulnerability allowing unauthorized access

8. Missing Response Data
Issue:Doesn't return the created product details for client use
Production Impact:Clients need additional API calls to fetch product data

Corrected Implementation

- wrote correct implementation of the code in part1-code-review.js


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part 2: Database Design

Used PostgreSQL Schema (can also use Prisma ORM for type safe queries)
CODE FOR SQL is in part2-database-design.sql


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part 3: API Implementation

CODE FOR JS is in part3-low-stock-alerts.js
